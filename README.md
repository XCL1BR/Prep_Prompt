Prompt1
I want to learn X(Any Tech Stack). Please create a comprehensive study plan following the 80-20 rule, focusing on the core 20% of concepts that will allow me to start building projects. The plan should be structured week by week for Y weeks, with each week covering specific topics.

After the Y-week core learning period, please suggest 5 projects of increasing difficulty (from beginner to advanced) that will help me apply and expand my knowledge of python. For each project, provide a brief description and list the key concepts it will help reinforce.

Please ensure the plan is detailed enough for a beginner to follow, but also challenges me to think and problem-solve independently.

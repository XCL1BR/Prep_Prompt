##Prompt1
I want to learn X(Any Tech Stack). Please create a comprehensive study plan following the 80-20 rule, focusing on the core 20% of concepts that will allow me to start building projects. The plan should be structured week by week for Y weeks, with each week covering specific topics.

After the Y-week core learning period, please suggest 5 projects of increasing difficulty (from beginner to advanced) that will help me apply and expand my knowledge of python. For each project, provide a brief description and list the key concepts it will help reinforce.

Please ensure the plan is detailed enough for a beginner to follow, but also challenges me to think and problem-solve independently.

##Prompt2
Suppose You are learning Y Topic from X techstack then the prompt should be:
I'm learning about Conditional statements in Python. Please provide:

1. A concise explanation of Conditional statements, including its purpose and when it's commonly used.
2. A simple code example demonstrating Conditional statements.
3. Three common mistakes or misconceptions beginners often have about Conditional statements and how to avoid them.
4. Two real-world applications or scenarios where Conditional statements are particularly useful.
5. Three progressively challenging exercises that will help me practice using Conditional statements.

Please don't provide solutions, only the problem statements.

After providing this information, please ask me a thought-provoking question about Conditional statements that will encourage me to think deeper about its applications or implications.

##Prompt3
I'm about to start working on a X project, which involves Y. My current skill level in **Tech_Stack is beginner/intermediate/advance. Please provide:

1. A high-level overview of the main components or features this project should have.
2. A suggested project structure, including main files or modules I'll need to create.
3. Three key challenges I might face while building this project and general strategies to overcome them (without specific code solutions).
4. Two stretch goals I could aim for to make the project more complex once I've completed the basic functionality.
5. Three important concepts or skills from Python that this project will help me reinforce or learn.

Please phrase your response in a way that guides my thinking without providing explicit solutions.

# Python Learning and Projects Guide

## 1. Learning Python Using the 80-20 Rule

**Objective:** Learn Python by focusing on the core 20% of concepts that will allow you to start building projects. This 8-week plan will cover specific topics each week.

### Week-by-Week Learning Plan:
1. **Week 1:** Introduction to Python, variables, data types, and basic operations.
2. **Week 2:** Control structures - if statements, loops, and basic logic.
3. **Week 3:** Functions and scope - creating reusable code blocks.
4. **Week 4:** Data structures - lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples.
5. **Week 5:** Working with strings and basic input/output operations.
6. **Week 6:** Error handling and exceptions.
7. **Week 7:** Introduction to modules and file handling.
8. **Week 8:** Basic understanding of object-oriented programming.

### Project Suggestions Post Learning:
After the 8-week core learning period, here are 5 projects of increasing difficulty to help you apply and expand your knowledge of Python:

1. **Project 1:** Basic Calculator - Reinforces basic operations and functions.
2. **Project 2:** To-Do List Application - Practices data structures and file handling.
3. **Project 3:** Web Scraper - Introduction to web data extraction and working with external libraries.
4. **Project 4:** Simple Game (e.g., Tic-Tac-Toe) - Reinforces control structures and functions.
5. **Project 5:** Personal Diary with Data Analysis - Combines file handling, data structures, and some data manipulation.

## 2. Web Scraping Project Guide

**Objective:** Start working on a web scraping project focusing on data extraction.

### Guidance:
1. **High-level Overview:** Identify the key components or features this project should have, like URL fetching, parsing data, and saving data.
2. **Suggested Project Structure:** Outline the main files or modules you'll need, such as `main.py`, `scraper.py`, and `data_handler.py`.
3. **Challenges & Solutions:** Anticipate challenges like handling dynamic web content, rate limiting, and data cleaning. Strategize solutions like using appropriate libraries and data validation methods.
4. **Stretch Goals:** Consider adding advanced features like scraping multiple pages and storing data in a database.
5. **Key Concepts:** This project will reinforce skills in HTTP requests, data parsing, exception handling, and possibly regular expressions.

## 3. Learning Conditional Statements in Python

**Objective:** Understand and practice conditional statements in Python.

### Key Points:
1. **Explanation:** Conditional statements allow you to execute certain code based on conditions (e.g., `if`, `else`, `elif`).
2. **Code Example:**
    ```python
    age = 18
    if age >= 18:
        print("You are eligible to vote.")
    else:
        print("You are not eligible to vote.")
    ```
3. **Common Mistakes:**
   - Misplacing `elif` and `else`.
   - Forgetting to use colons (`:`) after conditionals.
   - Overcomplicating conditions that could be simplified.
4. **Real-world Applications:** 
   - Decision-making in apps (e.g., showing different UI elements).
   - Data validation and flow control in scripts.
5. **Exercises:**
   - **Exercise 1:** Write a program that checks if a number is positive, negative, or zero.
   - **Exercise 2:** Create a basic login simulation with predefined credentials.
   - **Exercise 3:** Build a grading system that assigns grades based on score ranges.
